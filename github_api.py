### Imports
- `os`: Operating system dependent functionality.
- `requests`: HTTP library for making API requests.
- `base64`: Encoding and decoding base64 data.
- `streamlit`: Library for building web apps.

### Variables
- `listallfile`: List to store file paths.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store file paths as keys and decoded content as values.

### Functions
- `fetch_code_files`: Function to fetch code files from a specified GitHub repository.

### Function parameters
- `owner`: GitHub repository owner's username.
- `repo`: GitHub repository name.
- `file_path='`: Path to the file in the repository.

### IF/Else
- Checks if the API request was successful by verifying the status code (`response.status_code == 200`).

### While loop
- Not used in the given code snippet.

### For loop
- Iterates through the fetched list of files and processes each file.

### Algorithm Used
- The code fetches code files recursively from a GitHub repository using the GitHub API.

### Suggestions
- Uncomment the example usage code to test the function with specific file details.
- Consider removing or improving the commented-out code for better clarity.
- Avoid using `print` statements for debugging in production code.
- Add error handling for potential exceptions during API requests.
- Revisit the use of global variables (`listallfile` and `list_of_contents`) for better code structure.
- Consider organizing the code into more functions for better modularity.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of complex logic within the function.
