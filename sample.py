# The following code snippet defines a function called llm_response that uses various libraries such as LangChain, Streamlit, OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings, FAISS, Language, and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to generate responses based on a given prompt, code, and context.

# The code includes the necessary imports from different libraries required for processing text and generating responses.

# The function llm_response takes parameters such as an API key, prompt, code, and context to generate a response based on the input.

# The function begins by setting the OpenAI API key as an environment variable and initializing a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split the context into smaller chunks.

# Next, it creates embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings based on the API key and a FAISS vector store from the text chunks obtained using the text splitter.

# It then initializes a ChatOpenAI model with specific parameters and defines a prompt template for processing the input prompt and code.

# Finally, the function creates a document chain and a retrieval chain to generate a response based on the input prompt, code, and context. The response is printed and returned as the final_response.

# The commented-out section at the end of the code includes a prompt, context, and code for testing the llm_response function with specific inputs.

# The llm_response function is called with empty API key, the predefined prompt, context, and code to demonstrate how it processes the input and generates a response.
