### Imports
- `requests` is imported for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- `base64` is imported for encoding and decoding the file content.
- `streamlit` is imported for creating web apps with Python.

### Variables
- `owner` and `repo` store the GitHub repository owner and repository name.
- `list_of_contents` is used to store the fetched contents of the repository.
- `list_all_files` contains a list of all the fetched files.

### Functions
- `GitHubRepoFetcher` class is responsible for fetching and processing files from a GitHub repository.
- `_fetch_contents` method fetches the contents of files in the repository recursively.
- `_fetch_file_content` method fetches and decodes the content of a specific file.
- `fetch_files` method initiates the recursive fetching of files from the repository.
- `display_files` method displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.

### Classes
- `GitHubRepoFetcher` class encapsulates the functionality related to fetching files from a GitHub repository.
- `Main` class contains the main execution point for the script.

### Classes's Attributes
- `owner` and `repo` in `GitHubRepoFetcher` class store the owner and repository details.
- `list_of_contents` and `list_all_files` store the fetched contents and all files respectively in `GitHubRepoFetcher` class.

### Classes's Methods
- `_fetch_contents` and `_fetch_file_content` are internal methods of the `GitHubRepoFetcher` class.
- `fetch_files` initiates the fetching of files from the repository.
- `display_files` displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.

### IF/Else
- The code uses if...else statements to handle different scenarios based on the response status code of the API requests.

### While loop
- There is no while loop used in the code.

### For loop
- `for file, content in self.list_of_contents.items():` loop is used to iterate over the fetched files and their content.

### Algorithm Used
- The code recursively fetches files from a GitHub repository and decodes their content for display.

### Data structures
- Dictionaries are used to store the fetched contents and files.

### Suggestions
- It's recommended to handle exceptions more gracefully by providing informative error messages and potentially logging errors.
- Avoid printing directly to the console within the class methods; consider using logging mechanisms for better traceability.
- It would be beneficial to include more error checking and validation in the code to handle edge cases effectively.
