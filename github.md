### Explanation of the code:
- **Imports**: The code imports necessary libraries such as `requests`, `base64`, and `streamlit`.
- **Variables**: The code defines variables like `owner`, `repo`, `list_of_contents`.
- **Functions**: The code defines methods inside the `GitHubRepoFetcher` class to fetch contents from a GitHub repository, fetch file content, fetch files recursively, and display fetched files. It also defines a static method `main` inside the `Main` class.
- **Function parameters**: The `GitHubRepoFetcher` class takes `owner` and `repo` as parameters in its constructor.
- **Classes**: The code defines two classes, `GitHubRepoFetcher` and `Main`.
- **Classes's Attributes**:
    - `GitHubRepoFetcher` has attributes `owner`, `repo`, `list_of_contents`, and `list_all_files`.
- **Classes's Methods**:
    - `GitHubRepoFetcher` class has methods `_fetch_contents`, `_fetch_file_content`, `fetch_files`, and `display_files`.
    - `Main` class has a static method `main`.

### IF/Else:
- The code uses if-else statements to check the response status codes and handle different scenarios.

### While loop:
- There are no while loops used in the code.

### For loop:
- The code uses for loops to iterate over files and contents in the `list_of_contents`.

### Algorithm Used:
- The code algorithmically fetches files and their contents from a GitHub repository recursively using the GitHub API.

### Data structures:
- The code uses dictionaries (`list_of_contents`) to store file paths as keys and their contents as values.

### Suggestions:
- Consider handling exceptions more gracefully by providing informative error messages or logging.
- Implement proper error handling for HTTP requests.
- Separate the fetching logic from the displaying logic for better separation of concerns.
- Add comments to explain complex logic or business rules.
- Consider using `st.write` for consistent output formatting in Streamlit.
- Avoid excessive printing to the console for large datasets.
