### Imports
- `requests`: Library for making HTTP requests.
- `base64`: Library for encoding and decoding data with base64.
- `streamlit`: Library for creating web applications.

### Variables
- `owner`: Username of the GitHub repository owner.
- `repo`: Name of the GitHub repository.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store fetched file contents.
- `list_all_files`: List to store paths of all fetched files.

### Functions
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches the contents of files in the repository recursively.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes the content of a specific file in the repository.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates the recursive fetching of files from the repository.
- `display_files`: Displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.
- `Main.main`: Main execution point for the script.

### Function Parameters
- `_fetch_contents`: `file_path` (optional, defaults to empty string).
- `_fetch_file_content`: `file_path`.
- `fetch_files`: No parameters.
- `display_files`: No parameters.
- `Main.main`: No parameters.

### Classes
- `GitHubRepoFetcher`: Class to fetch files from a GitHub repository.
- `Main`: Class containing the main execution point for the script.

### Classes's Attributes
- `owner`: Owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo`: Name of the GitHub repository.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store fetched file contents.
- `list_all_files`: List to store paths of all fetched files.

### Classes's Methods
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches the contents of files in the repository recursively.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes the content of a specific file in the repository.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates the recursive fetching of files from the repository.
- `display_files`: Displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.
- `Main.main`: Main execution point for the script.

### IF/Else
- Check if the response status code is 200 for successful API requests.
- Handle exceptions for failed API requests.

### While Loop
- There are no while loops in the provided code.

### For Loop
- Used to iterate over the fetched files and display them in Streamlit and console.

### Algorithm Used
- The script fetches files from a GitHub repository using the GitHub API.
- It decodes the content of each file and stores it for display.
- It utilizes recursion to fetch contents of directories within the repository.

### Data Structures
- Dictionary `list_of_contents` to store file paths and contents.
- List `list_all_files` to store all fetched file paths.

### Suggestions
- Instead of printing error messages directly, consider logging them for better error handling.
- Add error handling for cases where the GitHub API request fails.
- Consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each method and class.
- Optimize the display of files in Streamlit to improve user experience.
- Add docstrings to each function and class for better documentation.

Overall, the code structure is reasonable, and the script accomplishes the task of fetching and displaying files from a GitHub repository.
