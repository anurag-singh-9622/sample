1. Readability and Maintainability:
   - The code is well-formatted and easy to understand.
   - Meaningful variable and function names are used.
   - Proper indentation and use of comments are present.

2. Efficiency and Performance:
   - There are no obvious bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
   - The code could potentially be optimized for faster execution by implementing more efficient algorithms for fetching and processing files.

3. Error Handling and Testing:
   - The code handles potential errors gracefully by checking the response status code and raising exceptions when necessary.
   - There are no unit tests written to ensure functionality, which could be added for better error handling and testing.

4. Potential Bugs and Vulnerabilities:
   - The code does not introduce any common Python pitfalls or security vulnerabilities.
   - However, additional input validation and error handling could improve the code's robustness.

5. Specific Examples:
   - The `_fetch_contents` method fetches the contents of files in the repository recursively.
   - The `_fetch_file_content` method fetches and decodes the content of a specific file in the repository.
   - The `fetch_files` method initiates the recursive fetching of files from the repository.
   - The `display_files` method displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.

6. Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Implement unit tests to ensure functionality and improve error handling.
   - Optimize the code for faster execution by considering more efficient algorithms.
   - Add more input validation and error handling to enhance the code's robustness.

7. Overall Rating:
   - The code quality is good overall, with room for improvement in terms of testing, optimization, and error handling.
