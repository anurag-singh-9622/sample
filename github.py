### Code Explanation

#### Imports
- `requests`: Used to send HTTP requests.
- `base64`: Used for encoding and decoding data in base64 format.
- `streamlit`: A library for creating interactive web apps.

#### Variables
- `owner`: Represents the owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo`: Represents the repository name.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store fetched file contents.
- `list_all_files`: List to store all file paths fetched.

#### Functions
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches file contents recursively from the repository.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes the content of a specific file.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates the fetching of files.
- `display_files`: Displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.

#### Function Parameters
- `owner`: Owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo`: Repository name.
- `file_path`: Path of the file in the repository.

#### Classes
- `GitHubRepoFetcher`: Class to fetch files from a GitHub repository.
- `Main`: Class with a static method `main()` as the entry point for the script.

#### Classes's Attributes
- `owner`, `repo`: Owner and repository name attributes.
- `list_of_contents`, `list_all_files`: Attributes to store file contents and paths.

#### Classes's Methods
- `_fetch_contents`, `_fetch_file_content`: Internal methods to fetch contents.
- `fetch_files`: Method to start fetching files.
- `display_files`: Method to display fetched files.

#### IF/ELSE
- Used to check the status code of the HTTP response.
- Handles cases where the response is successful or not.

#### While Loop
- Not used in the provided code.

#### For Loop
- Used to iterate over the fetched files and display them.

#### Algorithm Used
- The code recursively fetches file contents from a GitHub repository and decodes them using base64.
- It uses Streamlit to display the contents.

#### Data Structures
- Dictionary (`list_of_contents`) to store file contents.
- List (`list_all_files`) to store all file paths.

### Suggestions
- Ensure error handling for network-related errors and API rate limits.
- Consider adding more detailed comments for complex parts of the code.
- Implement logging mechanism for better debugging.
- Refactor `display_files` method to separate display logic from fetching logic for better modularity.
- Optimize API requests by considering pagination for large repositories.
