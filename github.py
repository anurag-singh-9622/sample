### Code Explanation

#### Imports
- `requests`: Used to make HTTP requests to the GitHub API.
- `base64`: Used for encoding and decoding base64 content.
- `streamlit as st`: Used for creating web apps with Python.

#### Variables
- `owner`: Owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo`: Name of the GitHub repository.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store file contents fetched.
- `list_all_files`: List to store paths of all files fetched.

#### Functions
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches contents of files recursively from the repository.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes content of a specific file in the repository.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates fetching of files from the repository.
- `display_files`: Displays fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.
- `main`: Main execution point for the script.

#### Function Parameters
- `_fetch_contents`: `file_path` (optional) - Path of the file to fetch.
- `_fetch_file_content`: `file_path` - Path of the file to fetch.
- `fetch_files`: No parameters.
- `display_files`: No parameters.
- `main`: No parameters.

#### Classes
- `GitHubRepoFetcher`: Class to fetch files from a GitHub repository.
- `Main`: Class that serves as the entry point for the script.

#### Classes' Attributes
- `owner`: Owner of the repository.
- `repo`: Name of the repository.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store fetched contents.
- `list_all_files`: List to store paths of all files fetched.

#### Classes' Methods
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches contents recursively.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes a specific file's content.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates fetching of files.
- `display_files`: Displays fetched files.

#### IF/Else
- Checks the status code of the API response to handle successful and failed requests.

#### While Loop
- Not present in the provided code.

#### For Loop
- Used to iterate over the fetched contents and display them.

#### Algorithm Used
- The script fetches files from a GitHub repository recursively, decodes their content, and displays them using Streamlit.

#### Data Structures
- Dictionary and list are used to store fetched file contents and paths.

### Suggestions
- Uncomment the `fetcher.display_files()` line in the `Main` class to display the fetched files.
- Consider error handling and logging mechanisms for better error reporting.
- Add input validation for the owner and repo values.
- Add docstrings for the classes and methods to provide better documentation.
- Improve the error handling in case of exceptions during content retrieval.
