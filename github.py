### Imports
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests.
- `base64`: Used for encoding and decoding data with base64 encoding.
- `streamlit`: A library for creating web apps with Python.

### Variables
- `owner`: Represents the owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo`: Represents the repository name.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store the contents of files fetched from the repository.
- `list_all_files`: List to store the paths of all files fetched.

### Functions
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches the contents of files in the repository recursively.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes the content of a specific file in the repository.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates the recursive fetching of files from the repository.
- `display_files`: Displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.
- `main`: Main execution point for the script.

### Function parameters
- `__init__`: Takes `owner` and `repo` as parameters to initialize the class.
- `_fetch_contents`: Takes `file_path` as an optional parameter for recursive fetching.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Takes `file_path` as a parameter to fetch the content of a specific file.

### Classes
- `GitHubRepoFetcher`: Class to fetch files from a GitHub repository.
- `Main`: Class representing the main execution point for the script.

### Classes's Attributes
- `owner`: Owner of the repository.
- `repo`: Repository name.
- `list_of_contents`: Dictionary to store file contents.
- `list_all_files`: List to store all file paths.

### Classes's Methods
- `_fetch_contents`: Fetches contents recursively.
- `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes file content.
- `fetch_files`: Initiates fetching of files.
- `display_files`: Displays fetched files.

### IF/Else
- Checks if the response status code is 200 for successful API requests.

### While loop
- Not present in the code.

### For loop
- Used to iterate over files and contents in `list_of_contents`.

### Suggestions
- Instead of printing the error message directly, consider raising an exception in `_fetch_contents` method.
- Add error handling for cases when `response.json()` doesn't contain the expected keys.
- Improve error handling in case of failed API requests.
- Avoid repetitive code by combining the display logic in a single method.
- Consider using Streamlit widgets for a more interactive display of fetched files.
- Add comments to explain complex logic or functionalities.
- Utilize error handling for Streamlit operations to prevent crashes.
- Implement logging to track the flow of the application and debug more effectively.
