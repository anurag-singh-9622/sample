### Code Explanation

#### Imports
- The code imports necessary libraries/modules like `requests`, `base64`, and `streamlit`.

#### Variables
- The code defines variables `owner`, `repo`, `list_of_contents`.

#### Functions
1. `GitHubRepoFetcher` class:
   - Constructor (`__init__`): Initializes the class attributes.
   - `_fetch_contents`: Recursively fetches the contents of files in the repository.
   - `_fetch_file_content`: Fetches and decodes the content of a specific file.
   - `fetch_files`: Initiates the recursive fetching of files from the repository.
   - `display_files`: Displays the fetched files in Streamlit and prints to the console.

2. `Main` class:
   - `main`: Main execution point for the script.

#### Function Parameters
- `owner` and `repo` are passed as parameters to the `GitHubRepoFetcher` class constructor.

#### Classes
- `GitHubRepoFetcher`: Manages the fetching of files from a GitHub repository.
- `Main`: Defines the main script execution.

#### Classes's Attributes
- `owner`, `repo`, `list_of_contents`, `list_all_files` are attributes of the `GitHubRepoFetcher` class.

#### Classes's Methods
- `_fetch_contents`, `_fetch_file_content`, `fetch_files`, `display_files` are methods of the `GitHubRepoFetcher` class.

#### IF/Else
- Conditional statements are used to handle responses from the GitHub API.

#### While Loop
- There are no while loops in the provided code.

#### For Loop
- For loops are used to iterate over files and content in the `list_of_contents`.

#### Algorithm Used
- The code uses a recursive algorithm to fetch all files and their contents from a GitHub repository.

#### Data Structures
- The code uses dictionaries (`list_of_contents`) to store the fetched files and their contents.

### Suggestions
- Consider handling exceptions more gracefully (e.g., logging errors, displaying proper error messages).
- Add more error checking and validation to handle unexpected scenarios.
- Improve comments and documentation for better code understanding.
