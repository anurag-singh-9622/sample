- Imported `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing HTML content.

### Variables
- `html_content`: Contains a sample HTML content.
- `doc`: Represents a new Word document.
- `soup`: Stores the parsed HTML content.
- `docx_output`: Holds the Word document in memory.

### Functions

### Function Parameters
- No functions defined in the code.

### Classes

### Classes's Attributes
- Not applicable.

### Classes's Methods
- Not applicable.

### IF/Else
- Used an `if-elif-else` statement to check the tag name and add appropriate content to the Word document.

### While Loop
- No while loop used in the code.

### For Loop
- Used a `for` loop to iterate over the selected HTML tags.

### Algorithm Used
- The code parses HTML content, extracts specific tags, and adds them to a Word document.

### Data Structures
- Utilized lists for storing tag names and paragraphs.

### Suggestions
- The code is well-structured and achieves its purpose.
- Consider handling exceptions during parsing and document creation.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of complex operations.
- Encapsulate the main logic in a function for reusability.
- Ensure proper error handling mechanisms are in place.
