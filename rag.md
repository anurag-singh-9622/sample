# Code Documentation

This code is a Python function that interacts with the Langchain framework to create a Vector store and send it to OpenAI for language model processing. The function `llm_response` takes in the OpenAI API key, a prompt, code, and context as input parameters. It then performs the following steps:

1. Set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
2. Split the provided context into texts using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
3. Create an OpenAIEmbeddings object using the API key.
4. Create a vector store using FAISS from the texts and embeddings.
5. Initialize a ChatOpenAI object for conversation with specified parameters.
6. Create a ChatPromptTemplate for the conversation prompt.
7. Create a document chain for processing documents.
8. Create a retrieval chain using the vector store and document chain.
9. Invoke the retrieval chain with the prompt and code.
10. Print and return the final response from OpenAI.

This code is designed to facilitate easy interaction with OpenAI's language model by leveraging the Langchain framework for processing and managing text data. It provides a structured and modular approach to handling conversations and document retrieval tasks efficiently.
