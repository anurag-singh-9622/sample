### Code Documentation

#### Imports
- `os`: Module for interacting with the operating system.
- `requests`: Module for sending HTTP requests.
- `base64`: Module for encoding and decoding base64 data.
- `streamlit as st`: Streamlit library for creating interactive web applications.

#### Variables
- `listallfile`: A list to store file paths.
- `list_of_contents`: A dictionary to store file paths as keys and decoded contents as values.

#### Functions
- `fetch_code_files(owner, repo, file_path='')`: Function to fetch code files from a given GitHub repository.
  
#### Function Parameters
- `owner`: Owner of the GitHub repository.
- `repo`: Name of the GitHub repository.
- `file_path`: Path of the file in the repository (optional).

#### IF/Else
- Checks if the API request was successful by verifying the response status code.

#### While loop
- Not used in the code snippet.

#### For loop
- Used to iterate over the fetched list of files and their contents.

#### Algorithm Used
- The code fetches files from a GitHub repository using the GitHub API and decodes the contents.

#### Data Structures
- Lists and dictionaries are used to store file paths and their contents.

### Suggestions
1. Uncomment and use the `github_api_url` variable inside the function or pass it as a parameter to `fetch_code_files`.
2. Avoid global variables like `listallfile` and `list_of_contents`, consider returning these values from the function.
3. Remove commented-out code blocks to maintain code cleanliness.
4. Consider handling exceptions and providing more informative error messages.
5. Use Streamlit functions consistently for displaying content instead of printing.
6. Add comments to explain complex logic or functionalities in the code.
