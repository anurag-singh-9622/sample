## Define Variables `prompt` and `context`
- `prompt`: Contains the prompt to create code documentation in Markdown format.
- `context`: Provides additional information about the purpose of the code and its functionality.

## Define Variable `code`
- Contains the code that needs to be documented, which includes functions to clear submit and push content to Confluence.
- The `confluence` function converts markdown to HTML, prepares the data for the API request, and sends a POST request to create a page on Confluence.
