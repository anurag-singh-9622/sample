- `time` for time-related functions

### Variables
- `api_form`, `api_submit_button`, `api`, `form`, `prompt`, `submit_button`, `download_btn`, `result`, `markdown_output`

### Functions
- `api_submit_btn`: Set the `api_submit_btn` to `True`
- `llm`: Generate response using OpenAI's `chat.completions.create` method
- `text_input`: Set `text` to `True`
- `click_button`: Set `clicked` to `True` and reset `download_clicked` to `False`
- `click_download_button`: Set `download_clicked` to `True`
- `cached_result`: Cache the result

### Function Parameters
- `promt` in the `llm` function

### Classes
- No classes defined in the code

### Classes's Attributes
- No classes defined in the code

### Classes's Methods
- No classes defined in the code

### IF/Else
- Check for `api_submit_btn` in `st.session_state` and proceed accordingly
- Check for `clicked` and `download_clicked` to trigger response generation and download respectively
- Display warnings or success messages based on conditions

### While Loop
- No while loop in the code

### For Loop
- No for loop in the code

### Algorithm Used
- The script uses the OpenAI API to generate responses based on user input.

### Data Structures
- The script uses forms and session_state in Streamlit to manage input and state.

### Suggestions
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `prompt` instead of `promt`).
- Unify the usage of comments in the code for better readability.
- Remove unused imports like `time`, `os`, `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`, and `from markdownify import markdownify as md`.
- Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Add error handling mechanisms to handle potential exceptions.
- Consider modularizing the code into smaller functions for better organization.
