### Imports
- The code imports the `OpenAI` class from a module named `openai`.
- The code also imports the `json` module for JSON handling.

### Variables
- `client`: An instance of `OpenAI` class.
- `prompt`: A string containing a sample order prompt.
- `function`: A list containing a dictionary with information about functions to be called.
- `response`: A response object from calling a function from the OpenAI client.
- `response_message`: A message extracted from the response object.

### Functions
- `fruit_list`: A function that takes `name`, `count`, and `address` as parameters and returns a formatted string.

### Function parameters
- `fruit_list` function takes `name`, `count`, and `address` as parameters.

### IF/Else
- The code uses an if-else block to check if a specific function is called.

### Algorithm Used
- The code utilizes OpenAI's API to interact with the GPT-3.5 model.

### Suggestions
- It's not recommended to include commented-out code in the production codebase. Remove unnecessary commented code blocks.
- Ensure error handling for scenarios where the expected keys are not present in the response_message.
- Consider adding documentation/comments to explain the purpose of the code blocks and functions for better readability.
- Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability by splitting it into smaller functions and classes if needed.
