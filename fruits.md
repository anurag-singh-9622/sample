# Code Documentation

### Imports
- `from openai import OpenAI`: Imports the `OpenAI` class from the `openai` module.
- `import json`: Imports the `json` module.

### Variables
- `prompt`: Contains a string with an order for apples.
- `function`: List of dictionaries specifying a function's name, description, and parameters.
- `response_message`: Stores the response message from OpenAI.

### Functions
- `fruit_list(name, count, address)`: Defines a function to generate a message about the ordered fruits.

### Function parameters
- `fruit_list(name, count, address)`: Takes `name`, `count`, and `address` as parameters.

### IF/Else
- Checks if a specific key is present in the response message and processes accordingly.

### Algorithm Used
- The code interacts with the OpenAI API to generate a response message based on the provided prompt.

### Suggestions
1. It's recommended to handle potential exceptions when accessing JSON data to avoid runtime errors.
2. Provide more descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.
3. Consider modularizing the code further to enhance readability and maintainability.
4. Utilize meaningful variable names for better code understanding.
5. Remove commented-out code blocks to keep the code clean and easier to read.
6. Add error handling to manage potential failures during API interactions.
