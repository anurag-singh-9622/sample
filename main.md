### Code Documentation

#### Imports
- `OpenAI` is imported from the `openai` module.
- `st` is imported from the `streamlit` module.
- `os` is imported to interact with the operating system.
- `time` is imported to work with time-related functions.

#### Variables
- `api_submit_btn`: boolean variable to track the status of the API submit button.
- `api_key`: variable to store the API key.
- `api`: variable to store the API key from the session state.
- `text`: boolean variable to track the status of the text input.
- `clicked`: boolean variable to track the button click status.
- `download_clicked`: boolean variable to track the download button click status.
- `response`: variable to store the response from the API.

#### Functions
- `api_submit_btn()`: sets the `api_submit_btn` variable to `True`.
- `llm(prompt)`: function that interacts with the OpenAI API to get completions based on the given prompt.
- `text_input()`: sets the `text` variable to `True`.
- `click_button()`: sets the `clicked` and `download_clicked` variables accordingly.
- `click_download_button()`: sets the `download_clicked` variable to `True`.
- `cached_result(result)`: function that processes the result for caching.

#### Classes

#### For loop
- No for loops in the provided code snippet.

#### Algorithm Used
- The code interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on user prompts.

#### Data structures

### Suggestions
- Organize code into functions and classes for maintainability.
- Implement error handling for exceptions.
- Use descriptive function and variable names.
- Remove commented-out code and unused imports.
- Add inline comments for complex logic.
- Secure sensitive information like API keys.
- Refactor repetitive code segments into functions.
- Improve readability with consistent indentation and spacing.
- Review API key submission and usage logic for better flow control.
