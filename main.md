### Code Documentation

#### Imports
- `OpenAI` is imported from the `openai` module.
- `st` is imported from the `streamlit` module.
- `os` is imported to interact with the operating system.
- `time` is imported to work with time-related functions.

#### Variables
- `api_submit_btn` is a boolean variable to track the status of the API submit button.
- `api_key` is a variable to store the API key.
- `api` is a variable to store the API key from the session state.
- `text` is a boolean variable to track the status of the text input.
- `clicked` is a boolean variable to track the button click status.
- `download_clicked` is a boolean variable to track the download button click status.
- `response` is a variable to store the response from the API.

#### Functions
- `api_submit_btn()` sets the `api_submit_btn` variable to `True`.
- `llm(prompt)` is a function that interacts with the OpenAI API to get completions based on the given prompt.
- `text_input()` sets the `text` variable to `True`.
- `click_button()` sets the `clicked` and `download_clicked` variables accordingly.
- `click_download_button()` sets the `download_clicked` variable to `True`.
- `cached_result(result)` is a function that processes the result for caching.

#### Classes
- There are no classes defined in the provided code snippet.

#### IF/Else
- Various if-else conditions are used to control the flow of the program based on button clicks and API key availability.

#### While loop
- There are no while loops in the provided code snippet.

#### For loop
- There are no for loops in the provided code snippet.

#### Algorithm Used
- The code snippet primarily interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on prompts provided by the user.

#### Data structures
- The code snippet uses variables to store API keys, button statuses, and API responses.

### Suggestions
- The code should be organized into functions and classes for better maintainability.
- Error handling mechanisms should be implemented to handle exceptions.
- Consider using a more descriptive function and variable names.
- Remove commented-out code and unused imports to keep the code clean.
- Add more inline comments to explain complex logic.
- Properly handle sensitive information like API keys (e.g., use environment variables).
- Consider refactoring repetitive code segments to functions.
- Improve code readability by following consistent indentation and spacing.
- Review the logic related to the API key submission and usage for better flow control.
